# Text-Encoding-and-Decoding
This project is created in Python using the Tkinter library for GUI. It allows the user to encode and decode the input string. The libraries used are Tkinter and Base64.

String Encoding and Decoding in Python using Tkinter is a project that allows the user to encode and decode the messages. The main libraries used are Tkinter and Base64. 

Tkinter in the Python library that is used to create and design Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

Base64 is a library that allows the user to encode and decode the string. The string to be encoded should be in byte form. The string variable will not work. For this reason, the encoding standard used here is "cp437". Another encoding standard includes ASCII. Any encoding standard which is accepted by Python3 and Base64 can be used for this purpose. In addition to base64, base 85 is also used to provide additional encoding. Base64 and Base84 are included in the newer versions of Python3, so be sure to check the version beforehand. 

Both Tkinter and Base64 come installed in Python3. If you use any previous Python versions, you can download the libraries using the following code:

pip install tkinter
pip install base64

Steps to Install the Program:

1. Download the project and unzip it into a folder.

2. Install the required libraries.

3. Open a Code Editor (Ex: VS Code)

4. Copy the code and run the program.
